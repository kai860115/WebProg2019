## Completeness(0~100%)?
```
$ points : 100%
$ The html file is perfectly aligned with the example image file that has been given. 
  All the tags are wisely used and at the same time the background color and the font 
  are changed by means of css file. Well done.
```
## Coding Equality
```
$ The html codes are facile to read.
$ The css codes are also terse.
```
## Virtue Worthy of The Imitation
```
$ It is quite laconic to put together all those tags that use the same font. Where I refered to is :
    h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, a, th, td, li {
        font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
    }
```
## Room for Improvement
```
$ There are still a lot of different syntax that can be used to make the html file more
  briliant. For example, "blockquote" or "Input" are good place to go.
$ Moreover, there are also various attributes that can be adjusted. For example, "font
  size", "margin", "text-align", "cursor", ... etc.
